# IRC Server Setup

#### Materials Used:
- Raspberry Pi
- ircd-hybrid
- Computer
- myIRC

### OVERVIEW
I used the guide at https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-irc-server/ to do the project. To set the server up was very simple and straight forward. This was also my first time using a Raspberry Pi so setting that up was intresting and took sometime. The main problem arised when trying to connect to it though. Only an IRC client that could take IP address would connect to the IRC server. That is why I used myIRC and when my professor tried with pidgin he could not. Then we learned we had to be connected to the ethernet inorder to connect due to the IT deparment blocking all but one port on the WI-FI.
